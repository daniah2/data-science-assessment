## 📌 Overview
This assessment involves writing a SQL query to calculate each investor's portfolio allocation percentage by sector.  
The result should return the following columns:

- `investor_id`
- `sector_name`

| File        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|

| `answer.sql` | Contains the final SQL query that calculates the portfolio allocation percentage for each investor by sector. |

## ▶️ How to Run

Execute the following command in the terminal:
python main.py

The program will:
- Build the test database.
- Run your SQL query.
- Compare your output with the expected result.

If the query is correct, the terminal will show:
- Test passed ✅

## 📸 Output Proof
A screenshot of the successful output (Test passed ✅) is included in this repository as proof of correct execution.
